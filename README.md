# Plural CD Demo Application

This is meant to be a simple demo microservice which can be managed by Plural.  It builds a single docker image, published to `ghcr.io/pluralsh/plrl-cd-test` and exposes a small flask api and prometheus metrics.

This can then be deployed easily within the context of a Plural Flow, or whatever other means you'd want to test against.


## Alerting and AI Driven fixes

Within `app/main.py` the `/ping` endpoint can deliberately fail for alerting demos, but only when `PING_FAILURE_ENABLED=true` is explicitly set. This preserves a reliable default for deployed applications while allowing a controlled fault-injection exercise when needed. When enabled, `/ping` returns an internal error during epoch seconds divisible by three.

An example fix PR we generated is here: https://github.com/pluralsh/plrl-cd-demo/pull/5.  This was actually a one-shot (you can verify in the PR history of the repo).
