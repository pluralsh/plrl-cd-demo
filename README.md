# Plural CD Demo Application

This is meant to be a simple demo microservice which can be managed by Plural.  It builds a single docker image, published to `ghcr.io/pluralsh/plrl-cd-test` and exposes a small flask api and prometheus metrics.

This can then be deployed easily within the context of a Plural Flow, or whatever other means you'd want to test against.


## Alerting and AI Driven fixes

This demo still includes a `/ping` endpoint for simple polling, but it now returns a stable successful response instead of intentionally failing. If log aggregation, and even better, vector indexing of PRs is enabled, you can still tie real prometheus or datadog alerts to root cause analysis using Plural AI.

An example fix PR we generated is here: https://github.com/pluralsh/plrl-cd-demo/pull/5.  This was actually a one-shot (you can verify in the PR history of the repo).
