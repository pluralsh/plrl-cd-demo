# Plural CD Demo Application

This is meant to be a simple demo microservice which can be managed by Plural.  It builds a single docker image, published to `ghcr.io/pluralsh/plrl-cd-test` and exposes a small flask api and prometheus metrics.

This can then be deployed easily within the context of a Plural Flow, or whatever other means you'd want to test against.


## Alerting and AI Driven fixes

This application includes a `/ping` endpoint for health checks.  With log aggregation and vector indexing of PRs enabled, you can tie a prometheus or datadog alert directly to a full root cause using Plural AI, and it can spawn a PR to fix broken code changes.

An example fix PR we generated is here: https://github.com/pluralsh/plrl-cd-demo/pull/5.  This was actually a one-shot (you can verify in the PR history of the repo).
